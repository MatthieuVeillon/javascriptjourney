Hi Guys,

You can read more about me in the bio section, in short this blog is going to be a tool, to help me learn javascript.

I expect it to help me reach several objectives :

1) discipline myself in learning and sharing (isn't it the best way to learn!) javascript content
2) allow share my up and down in my developer journey (I didn't expect this roller coaster)
3) playground to code
4) practice my english

Here are some subjects I intend to cover over 2019 (we'll see where we end!):

- JS fundamentals
- React in general
- Redux
- GraphQL
- WebPack
- Testing
- Learning general advices

There are already many precious and experienced teachers out there, to name a few and some of my favorites :

- **Kent C. Dodds** : I really enjoy Kent more technical articles and content in general, check his [egghead course](https://egghead.io/instructors/kentcdodds) and his [testing javascript platform](https://testingjavascript.com/)
- **Wes Bos** : I took some of his courses to start my JS journey, I literally love his podcast with Scott Tolinski : [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/)
- **Dave Ceddia** : I initially read his gatsby article to create this blog. I enjoy his [Newsletter](https://daveceddia.com/newsletter/).
- **Dan Abramov** : not a full time teacher but a react team core member, [Dan's blog](https://overreacted.io/) is a must read for react. I like his writing style too.

More than their expertise, I feel they approach web development and teaching in general with open heart and mind. I tend to learn better from people I can relate to in that sense.

To come back to this blog, I see myself as a student, who want to share his views as I'm currently struggling to learn and get better at web development.

We'll see if it works :)
