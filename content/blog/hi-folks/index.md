title: How to not learn Javascript.

description: Javascript is hard to learn. It's hard to know what to learn with the ressources overload
---

When I was preparing for my bootcamp a year and half ago I was tying to figure out the best way to learn. (still figuring...). What I learnt finally over the last year, is not what is the best way to learn Javascript, but rather what doesn't work for me.

So instead of recommending you what to do, I'm gonna focus on what failed for me.

The first questions I was trying to answer at the start is :
- What to learn ?
- How to learn ?

Those are vast questions, and there are a lot of ressources for each. From a general perspective and really specific to Javascript.

For both of those questions I had a systemic issue : **ressource overload**

I was litteraly trying to read too much. Anytime I was seeing a good article or a link recommended by someone it was ending on a todo list somewhere.
If you've been there, you might recognize you in the situation below :
- List of paid course on Udemy that you haven't even started (I'm talking about those 2yrs old course which are now outdated)
- Trello full of articles links that never shortens.
- Medium bookmark section that is not even scrollable anymore.

I'm still kind of there but I decided to not bookmark medium articles neither buying udemy course unless I'm actually starting
It led me to think


My learnings :
- Not too many topic at the same time
- Not too many ressources even in a future consideration. It doesn't

-


At the end I will still share what works for me :
- setting a deadline for a specific topic, Learning Redux by end of march was not working for me. I ended spending 6 months learning it dilletently.

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

- This however showed weasel
- Well uncritical so misled
  - this is very interesting
- Goodness much until that fluid owl

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

1.  So baboon this
2.  Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey
3.  Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung
4.  Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
    impassive fruitlessly shut

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view

question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

###### Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
